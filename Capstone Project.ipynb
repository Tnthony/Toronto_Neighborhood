However, due to increasing business relevance,  more people are relocating to live and working in Lagos with their family. The choice of local government Area (LGA) to reside is usually influenced by the availability of school for their childen to attend. Most peole will prefer to settle were there is similar school to were they are reloating from. \n \nI will leverge on Foursqauare location data and machine learning to find appropriate neighborhoods in Lagos were good international schools are located. \n\nThis is the problem I will like to solve in this coursera capstone project by using Foursquare API, location data and clustering method to group Lagos LGA based on the presence of schools"
